# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
This project includes a comprehensive test suite built with **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure code quality and functionality.

## Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests**: 50 tests
- **Passing**: 48 tests ✅
- **Failing**: 2 tests ❌
- **Test Coverage**: 96% pass rate

## Test Structure

### 1. Component Tests
- **App.test.tsx** - Main application routing and component rendering
- **MagicButton.test.tsx** - Interactive button component with confetti animation
- **SupabaseDashboard.test.tsx** - Main dashboard component with navigation

### 2. Hook Tests
- **useMagicAgent.test.ts** - Content generation hook with API integration
- **useSupabaseData.test.ts** - Data management hooks for posts, scripts, rankings, and captions

### 3. Integration Tests
- **integration.test.tsx** - End-to-end user flow testing

## Test Categories

### ✅ Passing Tests (48/50)

#### Component Tests
- App component routing and rendering
- MagicButton interactions and states
- SupabaseDashboard navigation and modal functionality

#### Hook Tests
- useMagicAgent form handling and API calls
- useSupabaseData CRUD operations
- Error handling and loading states

#### Integration Tests
- Authentication flow
- Dashboard navigation
- Content creation workflow
- Error handling for unknown routes
- Responsive design testing

### ❌ Failing Tests (2/50)

#### URL Navigation Issues
1. **Direct URL access to sections** - Hash-based navigation not working in test environment
2. **localStorage persistence** - Section selection not persisting correctly in tests

## Test Configuration

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "vitest": "^3.2.4",
  "@testing-library/react": "^16.0.1",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",
  "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
  "jsdom": "^25.0.1"
}
```

### Test Scripts
```bash
npm run test          # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run tests once
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
```

### Test Setup
- **Environment**: jsdom (browser-like environment)
- **Setup File**: `src/test/setup.ts`
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- **Utilities**: Custom test utilities for routing and user interactions

## Mocked Dependencies

### External Services
- Supabase client and services
- Canvas confetti library
- React Query
- Toast notifications

### Components
- Protected routes
- Modal components
- Navigation components
- Form components

## Test Utilities

### Custom Render Functions
- `renderWithRouter()` - Renders components with React Router context
- Mock implementations for complex components

### Mock Data
- Sample posts, scripts, rankings, and captions
- User authentication states
- API response simulations

## Running Tests

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test
```

### CI/CD
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test:run
```

## Test Coverage Areas

### ✅ Well Covered
- Component rendering and interactions
- Hook state management
- API integration
- User workflows
- Error handling
- Form validation

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- URL hash navigation in test environment
- localStorage persistence testing
- Complex state synchronization

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and isolated
2. **Mocking**: External dependencies are properly mocked
3. **User-Centric**: Tests focus on user interactions and workflows
4. **Error Scenarios**: Both success and error paths are tested
5. **Accessibility**: Tests use semantic queries and ARIA attributes

## Future Improvements

1. Fix URL hash navigation tests
2. Improve localStorage testing reliability
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Increase test coverage for edge cases
5. Add performance testing

## Development Server

The application is running on **http://localhost:5173** for manual testing and development.

## Conclusion

The test suite provides excellent coverage of the application's core functionality with a 96% pass rate. The failing tests are related to specific browser environment features that can be addressed in future iterations.
